# emulator_8086
An emulator for the 8086 based off the 'Performance Aware' programming course.

This is not a complete emulator. It does not handle segment registers; stack instructions;
many operations; etc... It has memory, standard registers and can execute mainly mov,
arithmetic instructions and conditional jumps. I may revisit this in the future to make
it a fully implemented emulator but I've decided to push on with the course for now.
It feels interesting enough that it should be backed up so I've made it into a GitHub repo.
